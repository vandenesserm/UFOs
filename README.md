# UFOs

## Overview:
The goal of this project is to produce a webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The final product will allow users to filter multiple criteria at the same time.
#
## List of requested deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

#
## Tools:
- GitBash
- Virtual Studio Code
- Google Chrome
#
## Results: 
- The page:
The final page looks clean and dynamic that responds to different-sized screens. The text is clear and easy to read. The product works as intended.

- The table and corresponding filter:
The table consists of 7 columns: Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and comments. Each occurrence is displayed in a row organized by date. The filters allow users to select a date, city, state, country, and/or shape.

The filter works simply by inputting data into the boxes and pressing enter. If a user wishes to see events that have been recorded in California, they would type "ca" and press enter. The results would show only occurrences set in ca.

If the user chooses to further narrow down by a specific shape, for example, they could type that shape into the box. The final result is a narrower table with only events that happened in California and which the shape was a triangle.

If the user wishes to further refine their research, they can keep on adding additional information.

## Summary: 
One drawback of this new design is that it does not allow for filtered data to be saved. One recommendation would be to create a function that allows users to filter and save their selected data. Furthermore, to make the website more informative and visually appealing, graphical data should be displayed to help users visualize patterns at a glance.
